## Recently Shipped (Next.js 16 Dependency Cleanup)

Removed `@eslint/eslintrc` and `@eslint/js` from `frontend/package.json` devDependencies + overrides block. Both were holdovers from the `FlatCompat` bridge that was removed in PR #904 (Next.js 16 upgrade) when `eslint-config-next` started exporting native flat config. Verified `eslint.config.mjs` imports `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals` and `eslint-config-next/typescript` directly with no FlatCompat usage. Local lint clean (0 errors / 29 pre-existing warnings unchanged).

First push hit the documented Windows-npm cross-platform lockfile fragility (per PR #1030 note): `npm uninstall` on Windows pruned the Linux-only `@emnapi/core@1.9.2` and `@emnapi/runtime@1.9.2` nested entries under `node_modules/@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi/node_modules/`, breaking Linux CI `npm ci`. Restored manually via registry-verified integrity hashes (29-line lockfile addition) — same fix pattern as PR #1030.

## Recently Shipped (Dependabot Major-Bump Drain)

After #1039 split groups into minor+patch only, Dependabot re-opened the held majors as individual PRs. All 9 were triaged sequentially: 6 merged (Tier 1 safe + Tier 2 verified-green), 3 closed for incompatible peers or unsupported ecosystem moves. quality_gate failures (workflow config bug — non-blocking) and Vercel "Canceled from dashboard" treated as acceptable per branch protection (4 required: Unit Tests, Playwright Smoke, Typecheck & Lint, Build).

## Recently Shipped (Dependabot Grouping Hardening)

PR #1038 grouped 13 npm updates including 6 incompatible majors (`@eslint/js` 9→10, `@vercel/speed-insights` 1→2, `lucide-react` 0.577→1.11, `sonner` 1→2, `tesseract.js` 5→7, `@types/node` 22→25) — all 10 gates failed and breakages could not be isolated atomically. Closed in favour of #1039: added `update-types: [minor, patch]` to all groups in `.github/dependabot.yml` (npm framework/sentry/supabase/testing/build-tooling/npm-rest + actions github-official/third-party). Major bumps now arrive as individual PRs for proper triage.

## Recently Shipped (Dependabot Alert #3 Closure)

Forced `tmp` package to patched version (>=0.2.4, resolved to 0.2.5) via npm `overrides` block in `frontend/package.json`, closing CVE-2025-54798 / GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6 (low-severity symlink temp write). Transitively reached only via `@lhci/cli@0.15.1` (devDep, already latest). `npm audit` now clean (was 4 low). Also repaired cross-platform lockfile: Windows-local `npm install` pruned Linux-only `@emnapi/*` optional deps required by `@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi`, breaking Linux CI `npm ci` — restored via manual nested entries with registry-verified integrity hashes.

Wired all four scripts in `scripts/` that validate repo hygiene into the `Repo Hygiene Verify` workflow. Forward-only enforcement for legacy-noisy checks (migration conventions) via PR-diff scope; appropriate-event scoping for age-based checks (doc freshness).

| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #916 | fix(scanner): resolve black camera feed with event-driven stream readiness (#889) |

**6 root causes diagnosed and fixed in scan/page.tsx:**
- `decodeFromVideoDevice()` not awaited → now properly awaited
- ZXing silently ignores `play()` rejection → 5s watchdog timeout added
- `playing` event may never fire → event-driven feed detection with fallback
- Stream readiness race condition → gated on `readyState >= 2` AND `videoWidth > 0`
- Missing `autoPlay` on video element → added for mobile browser compat
- "Scanning…" shown without feed verification → gated on `feedActive` state

**3 new tests + MediaStream jsdom stub. i18n: en/pl/de `scan.cameraStarting` key.**

### Non-Urgent Follow-Ups (from Next.js 16 upgrade)

These are documented follow-ups, not active work items. Address opportunistically or when opening next sprint.

1. **React Compiler lint warnings cleanup** — Phase 1 done in PR #1063 (resolved 6 violations: 1× `static-components`, 1× `purity`, 1× `preserve-manual-memoization`, 3× `refs`; promoted 4 of 5 rules from `warn` to default `error`). Phase 2: 17 remaining `set-state-in-effect` violations still at `warn` — dedicated cleanup pass when convenient, no urgency.
2. ~~**Remove `@eslint/eslintrc` and `@eslint/js` from devDependencies**~~ — ✅ Done in PR #1053 (2026-04-30). Restored Linux-only `@emnapi/*` nested lockfile entries to fix cross-platform CI break.
3. ~~**`middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` migration**~~ — ✅ Done in #1062. File renamed via `git mv`; exported function renamed `middleware` → `proxy`; deprecation warning eliminated.

## Staging Environment

- **Project:** `rxtaicdpnaqigowdbmsb` (`tryvit-staging`, eu-west-1)
- **Status:** ACTIVE_HEALTHY — schema deployed, reference data seeded, no product data
- **URL:** `https://rxtaicdpnaqigowdbmsb.supabase.co`
- **Schema:** 74 tables, 20 views, 4 materialized views, 257 functions, 128 RLS policies, 33 triggers
- **Reference data:** 2 countries, 22 categories, 7 nutri_score, 4 concern_tiers
- **GitHub secrets:** `SUPABASE_STAGING_PROJECT_REF`, `SUPABASE_URL_STAGING`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_STAGING`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_STAGING`, `STAGING_URL`
- **GitHub variable:** `STAGING_ENABLED=true`
- **CLI note:** When running `supabase db push` against staging, set `$env:SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` to the staging password first — the `--password` flag does NOT override the env var.

### Known QA Failures (Pre-existing, Non-blocking)

| Suite                  | Failures | Cause                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suite 7 (DataQuality)  | 6        | Ingredient coverage PL 58.4%/DE 16.3%, allergen coverage PL 44.5%/DE 13.3%, completeness PL 94%/DE 88.7% (all below threshold — OFF API data gaps) |
| Suite 10 (Naming)      | 2        | Trailing punctuation (24 products), HTML entities (4 products)                                                                                     |
| Suite 11 (NutriRange)  | 4        | Calorie back-calc (21), zero-cal macros (1), extreme salt (1), extreme calories (1)                                                                |
| Suite 12 (DataConsist) | 4        | nutri_score_source (fixed by PR #912), types (2), brands (886)                                                                                     |

**Root cause:** Suite 7 failures are OFF API data coverage gaps (enrichment data only available for ~58% PL, ~16% DE products).
Suites 10, 11, 12 are pre-existing source data quality issues unrelated to enrichment.

**Session 41 fixes (migration 20260316000700 + re-scoring):**
- Suite 1 (Integrity): PASS — 3,181 orphan ingredient_ref entries removed + 18 duplicate positions deduped
- Suite 2 (Scoring): PASS — Instant-Nudeln Beef DE anchor updated (53-57 → 43-47)
- Suite 6 (Confidence): PASS — resolved by enrichment restoration
- Suite 13 (Allergen): PASS — resolved by enrichment restoration
- Suite 15 (IngredQual): PASS — resolved by orphan cleanup
- Suite 21 (AllergenFilter): PASS — resolved by enrichment restoration
- Suite 31 (Determinism): PASS — resolved by post-dedup re-scoring
- Suite 32 (MultiCountry): PASS — resolved by DE re-scoring + post-dedup re-scoring
