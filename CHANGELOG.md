## [Unreleased]

### Scoring

- Implement v3.3 nutrient density bonus — protein and fibre credit that reduces
  unhealthiness score by up to 8 points. New `compute_unhealthiness_v33()` (11
  params: adds `p_protein_g`, `p_fibre_g`) and `explain_score_v33()` (returns 10
  factors). Tiered bonus: protein (0/15/30/40/50 at 5/10/15/20g) + fibre
  (0/10/20/35/50 at 1/3/5/8g). Weight −0.08, penalty weights unchanged (sum
  1.00). All 1,279 products re-scored. v3.2 retired in scoring_model_versions.
  Migration `20260315001900`. QA: 4 new determinism checks, 2 new engine checks,
  all 31 formula anchor ranges updated, view consistency check updated (10
  factors). Docs: SCORING_METHODOLOGY.md v3.3, copilot-instructions §14 (#608)

### Changed

- Update all scoring QA suites for v3.3 scoring formula with nutrient density
  bonus (protein + fibre): QA\_\_scoring\_formula\_tests.sql 31→35 checks (4 new
  v3.3-specific tests including nutrient density bonus validation and v3.3↔v3.2
  parity), QA\_\_scoring\_determinism.sql 17→21 checks (4 new pure-function tests
  for v3.3 floor, bonus ceiling, parity, and band coverage), QA\_\_scoring\_engine.sql
  updated to validate v3.3 as active version with 10 factors and weight sum 0.92,
  QA\_\_view\_consistency.sql updated for 10-factor score\_breakdown, all 16 anchor
  product regression ranges recalibrated for v3.3 nutrient density impact (#613)
- Update score explanation API and UI for v3.3 nutrient density factor:
  `api_score_explanation()` now returns `nutrient_bonus` object with protein/fibre
  component breakdown; ScoreBreakdownPanel renders green nutrient density bonus
  section; ScoreRadarChart shows 10th axis with green accent; positive warnings
  for good protein (≥10g) and fibre (≥3g); learn page and i18n updated for
  10-factor model (#611)
- Re-score all 1,671 active products with v3.3 nutrient density bonus (protein +
  fibre credit); 1,667 products unchanged, 4 DE products drifted within expected
  range (max |Δ|=5); updated 11 QA regression anchor ranges and copilot-instructions
  anchor references to reflect v3.3 scores (#610)

### Data

- Scale all 20 PL categories to maximum OFF API capacity: 1,198 active PL
  products (up from 1,027), 1,450 total active across PL + DE; regenerated
  pipeline SQL for all 20 categories with `--max-products 95`; added
  post-pipeline fixup steps for calorie back-calculation validation, zero-calorie
  macro correction, brand casing normalization, orphan junction cleanup, and
  Żabka reclassification reason backfill (#593)
- Validate protein/fibre backfill readiness for v3.3 nutrient density bonus:
  audit confirms 100% non-NULL coverage for both `protein_g` (1,671 products)
  and `fibre_g` (1,671 products); pipeline SQL generator and OFF API client
  already include both fields in extraction and upsert; `compute_data_completeness()`
  already includes both in its 15-checkpoint system (#609)

### Tests

- Add 2 QA checks to nutrition ranges suite (18 → 20 checks, total 733 → 735):
  protein_g NULL coverage < 5% threshold and fibre_g NULL coverage < 10%
  threshold — required for v3.3 nutrient density bonus (#609)

### Documentation

- Overhaul scoring docs for TryVit Score consumer display layer: add §2.8
  Consumer Display Layer (TryVit Score = 100 − unhealthiness, band table with
  consumer labels Excellent/Good/Moderate/Poor/Bad, rationale for higher=healthier
  inversion) and §2.9 Category Percentile to SCORING_METHODOLOGY.md; add
  consumer-facing columns to §2.6 band table; add §10.1 TryVit Score and
  regression anchor notes to SCORING_ENGINE.md; update copilot-instructions §14
  with consumer display note and dual-column band table (#591)

### Fixed

- Fix QA data consistency check 1 (case-insensitive duplicate detection): add
  country-scoping to the JOIN condition so cross-country products with the same
  brand+name (e.g. Pepsi PL vs Pepsi DE) are not flagged as duplicates (#593)

- Remove 11 ESLint `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion` warnings across 8
  frontend files: replace `!` assertions with optional chaining (`?.`), nullish
  coalescing (`??`), type-safe index access, or defensive type guards — no
  behavioral changes, same error paths, same happy paths (#555)

- Fix nightly data integrity audit false-positive criticals: tighten
  `audit_score_band_contradictions()` thresholds to only flag truly extreme
  Nutri-Score vs unhealthiness contradictions (≥4 band gap) as critical;
  downgrade moderate disagreements (2-3 band gap) to warnings — these are
  expected for single-factor products (fruit juice, sugar, condiments) where
  Nutri-Score and our 9-factor formula legitimately disagree; eliminates all 18
  false criticals that caused persistent nightly CI exit(1) (#554)

- Provision deterministic QA fixture data for quality-gate and nightly CI
  workflows: new `seed-fixtures.mjs` script seeds 4 synthetic dairy products
  (with nutrition, allergens, ingredients) into staging Supabase via service-role
  key; `quality-gate.yml` and `nightly.yml` run the seeder before Playwright,
  capturing product IDs into `$GITHUB_ENV` for `fixtures.ts` to consume;
  removes hardcoded `QA_PRODUCT_ID` secret dependency (#553)

### Changed

- Fix documentation count drift: update 9 migration count references from 184 to
  185 across `copilot-instructions.md`, `README.md`, and
  `docs/PRODUCTION_DATA.md`; update `CURRENT_STATE.md` for session 14 (open
  issues, metrics); reorder imports in `TrafficLightStrip.tsx` (formatter, no
  functional change) (#562)

- Rename project from `poland-food-db` to `TryVit` across all source files:
  package names, app metadata, CI/CD config, documentation, i18n values, and
  test fixtures (#539); new brand identity: vitGreen `#1DB954` / vitDark
  `#0A2E1A`; PWA manifest name → `TryVit`; SonarCloud project key →
  `ericsocrat_tryvit`; GitHub repo → `ericsocrat/tryvit`; design-tokens v2.0.0
  with full TryVit colour palette replacing legacy teal `#0d7377` tokens

### Security

- Add CAPTCHA + trust integration to API gateway (Phase 3): Turnstile token
  verification for `submit-product` when trust < 50 or velocity > 3/hour;
  trust score lookup via service-role client against `user_trust_scores`;
  high-trust users (score > 80) bypass CAPTCHA entirely; graceful degradation on
  missing secret key, Turnstile API failure, or missing service-role key;
  frontend `isGatewayCaptchaRequired` + `isGatewayCaptchaFailed` type guards;
  `SubmitProductParams.turnstile_token` optional field; 11 new Vitest tests
  (60 total) (#478)
- Add Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA integration for signup bot protection:
  `verify-turnstile` Edge Function (server-side token verification with graceful
  degradation), `TurnstileWidget` React component wrapper, `turnstile.ts` client
  helper lib; SignupForm now requires Turnstile challenge before submission with
  `captchaToken` passed to Supabase Auth; i18n keys for EN/PL/DE; `.env.example`
  updated with Turnstile site/secret key config; 45 Vitest tests (19 lib +
  12 component + 14 signup form) (#470)
- Add API gateway Edge Function (`supabase/functions/api-gateway/`) for write-path
  defense: JWT validation, action-based routing, in-memory sliding-window rate
  limiting (100 scans/day/user), EAN format validation, structured error responses
  with graceful degradation fallback; frontend wrapper `api-gateway.ts` with
  18 Vitest tests (#478)
- Add product submission protection to API gateway (Phase 2): `submit-product`
  action with GS1 EAN checksum validation, input sanitization (field length caps,
  forbidden character rejection), 10/day rate limiting; frontend
  `submitProductViaGateway()` with graceful degradation fallback; 14 new Vitest
  tests (32 total) (#478)
- Add telemetry and search gateway protection (Phase 4): `track-event` action
  (10K/day rate limit, event_name/device_type/event_data validation, payload size
  cap) + `save-search` action (50/day rate limit, name/query sanitization, filters
  validation); frontend `trackEventViaGateway()` and `saveSearchViaGateway()` with
  graceful degradation fallback; 17 new Vitest tests (49 total) (#478)

### Schema & Migrations

- Add Nutri-Score country applicability: `country_ref.nutri_score_official` boolean
  (DE=true, PL=false) + `products.nutri_score_source` provenance column with CHECK
  constraint (`official_label`, `off_computed`, `manual`, `unknown`); backfill 1,128
  scored products as `off_computed`, 102 UNKNOWN as `unknown`; expose in
  `api_product_detail`, `api_category_listing`, `api_score_explanation`; add
  contextual `nutri_score_note` to score explanation; +2 QA data-consistency
  checks, +3 schema-contract tests, +8 pgTAP functional tests (#353)

### CI & Infrastructure

- Add deterministic repo hygiene enforcer: `scripts/repo_verify.ps1` — 6 checks
  (root cleanliness, docs index coverage, ADR naming, migration ordering,
  no tracked artifacts, no temp files) with CI workflow `repo-verify.yml`
  on push/PR/weekly cron (#334)
- Add automated DR drill CI workflow (`.github/workflows/dr-drill.yml`): monthly
  cron + manual dispatch, ephemeral PostgreSQL 17 container, applies all migrations
  + seed + representative pipeline SQL + QA smoke subset, produces JSON report
  artifact (#333)
- Codify monitoring alerts as `monitoring/alerts.yml` (17 alerts extracted from
  ALERT_POLICY.md); add `validate-alerts.yml` CI workflow + `scripts/validate_alerts.py`
  validation script; update ALERT_POLICY.md to reference YAML as source of truth (#332)
- Add Python linter (ruff) with `ruff.toml` config and `python-lint.yml` CI
  workflow; auto-fix 22 violations, resolve remaining 7 manually; enforce on
  PRs touching Python files (#331)

### Documentation

  `complete_backfill`, `fail_backfill`), `v_backfill_status` monitoring view,
  `scripts/backfill_template.py` Python template (#208)
- Add migration convention standard: index naming convention `idx_{table}_{columns}[_{type}]`,
  trigger domain range assignments (10–99 by domain), migration file naming format with header
  block standard, `_TEMPLATE.sql` reference template, `check_migration_conventions.py` validation
  script (133/133 naming compliant) (#207)
- Rename non-conforming triggers on `products` table: `score_change_audit` →

  triggers, `check_formula_drift()` and `check_function_source_drift()` sentinel functions (#198)

### Scoring & Methodology

### Data & Pipeline

### API & Backend

### Frontend & UI

- Add trust & transparency components: `TrustBadge` (data confidence level),
  `FreshnessIndicator` (data age with fresh/aging/stale thresholds),
  `ScoringVersionBadge` (formula version display), `SearchRelevanceHint`
  (match type indicator), `SourceAttribution` (expandable per-field source
  panel). All components degrade gracefully when backend data is unavailable.
  Includes i18n (en + pl), barrel export, and 70+ co-located Vitest tests (#205)

### Search & Discovery

### Security & Auth

### Testing & QA

- Add multi-country consistency & performance regression test suites:
  `QA__multi_country_consistency.sql` (10 blocking checks — cross-country scoring
  equivalence, country_ref integrity, DE micro-pilot constraints, data completeness
  parity, recomputed-vs-stored parity across all countries) and
  `QA__performance_regression.sql` (6 informational checks — CI smoke thresholds
  for search, autocomplete, category listing, product detail, score computation,
  better alternatives) (#204)

  active scoring/search formulas, fingerprint population, drift detection, source hash verification,
  and auto-fingerprint trigger validation (#198)
- Add `QA__governance_drift.sql` with 8 checks: function existence, 8-check return count,
  all-pass clean state, valid severities, non-empty details, results table, logging function,
  unique check names (#199)

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-24 (Project Baseline)

> First structured release of the platform. Captures the cumulative state after
> 130 migrations, 21 pipeline folders, and full frontend implementation.

### Schema & Migrations
- 130 append-only migrations establishing full schema
- 17 tables: `products`, `nutrition_facts`, `ingredient_ref`, `product_ingredient`,
  `product_allergen_info`, 5 reference tables (`country_ref`, `category_ref`,
  `nutri_score_ref`, `concern_tier_ref`, `data_sources`), 6 user tables
  (`user_preferences`, `user_health_profiles`, `user_product_lists`,
  `user_product_list_items`, `user_comparisons`, `user_saved_searches`,
  `scan_history`, `product_submissions`)

### Security & Auth
- Supabase Auth with magic link + OAuth
- RLS on all user tables (preferences, lists, comparisons, scan history)
- `SECURITY DEFINER` functions with `REVOKE`/`GRANT` access control
- Security posture QA suite (22 checks)
- Feature flags with `data_provenance_ui` flag (disabled by default)

### Testing & QA
- 429 checks across 30 QA suites (all blocking)
- 23 negative validation tests (SQL injection, constraint violations)
- 232 frontend test files (Vitest + Testing Library)
- Playwright E2E tests (smoke + authenticated flows)
- pgTAP-style tests for API functions
- SonarCloud quality gates with coverage enforcement
- EAN checksum validator, pipeline structure validator

### Documentation
- 33 docs covering API contracts, scoring methodology, country expansion,
  data provenance, search architecture, UX impact metrics, and more
- Copilot instructions (§1–§15) with governance framework
- Execution Governance Blueprint (#195)

### CI/CD & Infrastructure
- PR Gate: Typecheck → Lint → Build → Unit Tests → Playwright Smoke
- Main Gate: Build → Tests + Coverage → Playwright → SonarCloud
- QA Gate: Pipeline structure → Schema → Pipelines → QA (429) → Sanity
- Nightly: Full Playwright + Data Integrity Audit
- Deploy: Manual trigger → Schema diff → Approval → Backup → Push → Sanity

- API response shape change (columns removed from views)
- Table column removed or renamed
- CHECK constraint domain changed (e.g., new `prep_method` value)
- RLS policy changed (access pattern affected)
- Category added or removed (affects `category_ref`)
- Country activated or deactivated (affects `country_ref`)
