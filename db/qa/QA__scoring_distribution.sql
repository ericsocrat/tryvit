-- QA Suite: Scoring Band Distribution Monitoring
-- 12 checks — verifies scoring band health at scale
-- Non-blocking (informational) — thresholds will be calibrated at 10K scale
-- Historical diagnostics only: consumers no longer receive an overall score.
-- Keep all 12 findings and their thresholds visible; they do not establish
-- consumer evidence correctness. RUN_QA separately requires the executable
-- consumer-retirement contract suites and treats execution errors as failures.
-- Issue: #865
