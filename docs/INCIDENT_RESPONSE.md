## 1. Purpose

This playbook defines the incident response process for the TryVit.
It provides severity definitions, an escalation ladder, communication templates,
a blameless post-mortem format, and scenario-specific runbooks for common failure modes.

Even as a solo-developer project, having a documented process prevents panic-driven
decisions, ensures consistent response quality, and scales naturally when contributors join.

## 2. Severity Classification

| Level     | Name     | Definition                                                        | Response Time     | Resolution Target |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **SEV-1** | Critical | Complete service outage or data corruption affecting all users    | **15 min**        | **1 hour**        |
| **SEV-2** | Major    | Partial outage or degraded experience for significant user segment | **30 min**        | **4 hours**       |
| **SEV-3** | Minor    | Non-critical functionality degraded; workaround exists            | **2 hours**       | **24 hours**      |
| **SEV-4** | Low      | Cosmetic or informational; no user impact                         | **Next bus. day** | **1 week**        |

### Examples by Severity

| SEV-1 (Critical)                         | SEV-2 (Major)                               |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Database completely unreachable           | Search broken for all users                 |
| All API endpoints returning 5xx          | Category listing empty or missing products  |
| Scoring function producing wrong values  | Auth flow failing (login/signup)            |
| Data loss or corruption detected         | Materialized views stale > 24 hours         |

| SEV-3 (Minor)                            | SEV-4 (Low)                                  |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Single product detail returning 404      | Typo in UI text                              |
| Slow queries exceeding P95 SLO           | Non-blocking CI warning                      |
| One QA suite failing (non-scoring)       | Coverage dip < 1%                            |
| EAN validation mismatch on 1 product     | Stale documentation                          |

### Severity Decision Tree

```
Is the platform completely inaccessible?
├── YES → SEV-1
└── NO → Is data being corrupted or lost?
    ├── YES → SEV-1
    └── NO → Are >50% of users affected?
        ├── YES → SEV-2
        └── NO → Is a core feature broken (search, scoring, auth)?
            ├── YES → SEV-2
            └── NO → Is there a user-facing issue with a workaround?
                ├── YES → SEV-3
                └── NO → SEV-4
```

> **Judgment call:** Incidents near severity boundaries should be escalated to the
> higher severity and downgraded after investigation if appropriate. When in doubt,
> round up.

## 3. Escalation Ladder

### Solo Developer Model (Current)

| Step | Action                                                          | Owner | Timeframe                          |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------|
| 1    | Alert received (Sentry / Supabase / CI / manual report)        | Eric  | T+0                                |
| 2    | Acknowledge alert, classify severity                            | Eric  | T+15 min (SEV-1/2), T+2h (SEV-3/4)|
| 3    | Open GitHub issue with `incident` label + severity label        | Eric  | With acknowledgment                |
| 4    | Apply immediate mitigation (rollback, disable feature, scale)   | Eric  | Within response time               |
| 5    | Investigate root cause                                          | Eric  | Ongoing                            |
| 6    | Deploy permanent fix                                            | Eric  | Within resolution target           |
| 7    | Write post-mortem (SEV-1/2 mandatory, SEV-3 optional)           | Eric  | Within 48h of resolution           |
| 8    | Implement preventive measures (tests, alerts, guards)           | Eric  | Within 1 week                      |

### Future Team Model

When contributors join, expand the escalation ladder with role rotation:

| Role                | Responsibility                                                |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incident Commander  | Coordinates response, makes severity/escalation decisions     |
| Investigator        | Performs root cause analysis, implements fix                   |
| Communicator        | Posts status updates, notifies stakeholders                   |

Rotate roles per incident to distribute knowledge and prevent single points of failure.

**Author:** [Name]
**Status:** [Draft / Final]

## Summary
[2-3 sentence summary of what happened and its impact]

## Impact
- **Users affected:** [count or percentage, or "all" / "none"]
- **Data integrity:** [any data loss or corruption? recovery status]
- **SLO impact:** [which SLOs breached, by how much — ref docs/SLO_REGISTRY.md if exists]
- **Duration of degradation:** [time from detection to resolution]

## Timeline (UTC)
| Time  | Event                          |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| HH:MM | Alert triggered by [source]   |
| HH:MM | Acknowledged, classified SEV-N |
| HH:MM | Investigation started          |
| HH:MM | Root cause identified          |
| HH:MM | Mitigation applied             |
| HH:MM | Full resolution confirmed      |

## Root Cause
[Detailed technical explanation — focus on systems, not individuals.
This section should answer: "What broke?" and "Why did it break?"]

## What Went Well
- [Detection was fast because...]
- [Rollback procedure worked as documented because...]

## What Went Wrong
- [Alert was delayed because...]
- [Recovery took longer than expected because...]

## Action Items
| Action                       | Owner | Deadline   | Issue |
|------------------------------|-------|------------|-------|
| [Preventive measure]         | Eric  | YYYY-MM-DD | #NNN  |
| [Detection improvement]      | Eric  | YYYY-MM-DD | #NNN  |
| [Process/doc improvement]    | Eric  | YYYY-MM-DD | #NNN  |

## Lessons Learned
[Key takeaways for future incident response]
```

> **Blameless culture:** Post-mortems focus on systems and processes, never on
> individuals. Ask "what failed?" not "who failed?"

## 8. SLO Breach Response

When a service-level objective is breached, follow the corresponding procedure:

| Breach Type                       | Severity | Action                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Latency SLO** (P95/P99)        | SEV-2/3  | Check MV freshness → EXPLAIN ANALYZE → index review → scale guardrails QA                |
| **Availability SLO** (< 99.5%)   | SEV-1/2  | Follow Runbook 1 (DB down) or Runbook 4 (auth) depending on failure mode                 |
| **Error budget exhausted** (crit.)| SEV-2    | Feature freeze until SLO restored; focus only on reliability fixes                       |
| **Error budget exhausted** (std.) | SEV-3    | Prioritize reliability over features; no new deployments until budget recovers            |
| **Data quality SLO** (QA fails)  | SEV-2    | Follow Runbook 3 (data corruption); block pipeline runs until resolved                   |

> **Error budget policy:** When error budget for a critical SLO is exhausted,
> all non-reliability work stops until the SLO is restored. This prevents
> feature velocity from eroding platform reliability.

## 9. GitHub Labels for Incidents

When opening an incident issue, apply these labels:

| Label              | When to use                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `incident`         | All incidents (mandatory)                |
| `sev-1`            | Critical incidents                       |
| `sev-2`            | Major incidents                          |
| `sev-3`            | Minor incidents                          |
| `sev-4`            | Low-priority incidents                   |
| `post-mortem`      | Issue tracking a post-mortem document    |

> **Note:** Create these labels when the first real incident occurs. No need
> to pre-create labels for a process that hasn't been used yet.

## 10. Integration Points

| System                | Role in Incident Response                                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sentry**            | Error tracking — triggers SEV-2/3 alerts for frontend/API errors        |
| **Supabase Dashboard**| Database health monitoring — triggers SEV-1 for connection failures      |
| **GitHub Actions**    | CI/CD health — triggers SEV-3 for pipeline failures                     |
| **Vercel**            | Frontend deployment status — triggers SEV-2 for build/deploy failures   |
| **`.\RUN_QA.ps1`**    | Data integrity verification — 777 checks across 49 suites              |
| **`.\RUN_SANITY.ps1`**| Quick health check — 17 row-count and schema assertions                 |

## 11. Quarterly Review

Review this playbook quarterly to ensure:

- [ ] Runbook commands still reference correct file names and paths
- [ ] QA check counts match actual suite totals
- [ ] Severity examples remain relevant to current features
- [ ] SLO thresholds are still accurate
- [ ] Communication templates match current team structure
- [ ] Post-mortem action items from past incidents have been completed
