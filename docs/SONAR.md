# SonarCloud Configuration

## Overview

This project uses [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) for static analysis.
The project is configured in `sonar-project.properties` at the repo root.

- **Organization:** `ericsocrat`
- **Project key:** `ericsocrat_tryvit`
- **Dashboard:** <https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=ericsocrat_tryvit>

## Quality Gate Strategy

We use the **"Clean as You Code"** approach:

- **New code only** — the quality gate evaluates new/changed lines,
  not the entire legacy codebase.
- PRs must have **0 new Bugs**, **0 new Vulnerabilities**, and
  **0 unreviewed Security Hotspots** to pass.
- Coverage on new code has a starter threshold (currently low)
  that will be raised as more tests are added.

Legacy code smells are paid down opportunistically in files we touch,
not via bulk refactor PRs.

## Coverage Reporting

Unit tests are written with **Vitest** and produce an `lcov` report.

```bash
# Run tests only
cd frontend && npm test

# Run tests with coverage
cd frontend && npm run test:coverage
```

The coverage report is generated at `frontend/coverage/lcov.info`.
SonarCloud reads it via:

```properties
sonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths=frontend/coverage/lcov.info
```

## SQL File Exclusions

All SQL pipeline and migration files are **excluded** from Sonar analysis:

| Exclusion pattern        | Reason                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `db/pipelines/**`        | Seed-data INSERT scripts — produce ~2k false-positive "duplicate literal" warnings. |
| `db/migrations/**`       | Schema migration scripts, not application logic.                                    |
| `supabase/migrations/**` | Supabase migration scripts.                                                         |

### PL/SQL Data Dictionary Warning

SonarCloud's PL/SQL analyzer can warn:

> *"Data Dictionary is not configured for the PL/SQL analyzer…"*

This happens because SonarCloud supports deep PL/SQL analysis when
connected to a live database, but we don't configure that. Our approach:

1. **Exclude SQL files** from Sonar sources (see table above).
2. **Restrict PL/SQL file suffixes** to `.plsql`, `.pkb`, `.pks`, `.pkg`
   — our `.sql` files won't be matched by the PL/SQL analyzer.
3. If we ever need deep SQL analysis, we'd configure a data dictionary
   connection per the SonarCloud docs.

## CI Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/main-gate.yml`) runs
five parallel jobs after each push to `main`:

- **static-checks** — TypeScript strict check (`tsc --noEmit`) + ESLint
- **unit-tests** — Vitest with v8 coverage → lcov
- **build** — Next.js production build
- **e2e** — Playwright Chromium E2E smoke tests (needs build)
- **sonar** — SonarCloud scan + Quality Gate check (**BLOCKING**, needs unit-tests for coverage artifact)

An `alert-on-failure` job fires a webhook if any job fails on `main`.

| `@supabase/ssr` deprecated overload warning (TS6387)                                             | Library keeps the old overload for backward compat. Our code uses the correct `getAll`/`setAll` API.                                    | Will resolve when `@supabase/ssr` v1.0 ships.                      |
| Middleware matcher uses escaped `\\.` in a string (Sonar S7770 prefers `String.raw`)             | Next.js requires a **plain string literal** in `config.matcher` for static analysis. `String.raw` tagged templates break the build.     | Suppressed via `sonar.issue.ignore` in `sonar-project.properties`. |
| SearchAutocomplete uses `role="listbox"` / `role="option"` (Sonar S6819 prefers native elements) | WAI-ARIA 1.2 combobox pattern requires these ARIA roles on custom elements — native `<select>`/`<option>` cannot be styled for this UX. | Suppressed via `sonar.issue.ignore` in `sonar-project.properties`. |
| Tailwind `@custom-variant` uses `&` under `@slot` (Sonar CSS S8776 reports a missing root)           | Tailwind v4 supplies the selector scope through its build-time DSL; the production compiler and tests validate the emitted variant.   | Suppressed only for S8776 in `frontend/src/styles/globals.css`.    |
| Generated Design System V2 token artifacts contain repeated object/CSS structures                 | The manifest and generator are analyzed and contract-tested; emitted `generated/**` files are deterministic build products.           | Generated artifacts are excluded from Sonar source/CPD analysis.  |
| ~117 legacy maintainability issues                                                               | Inherited from initial rapid development.                                                                                               | Paid down gradually in touched files; not bulk-fixed.              |
